The target variable is solar_system_count. This variable is a binary variable indicating the coverage of solar power systems in a given
tile. The variable takes outcome low if the tile has a low number of solar power systems (less than or equal to 10), while it takes outcome high if the tile has a large number of solar power systems (more than 10).
Use the supervised classification methods described in this course to predict the solar power system coverage of a tile given the 
collection of predictor features. Use a range of methods and evaluate/discuss their relative merits. In the end, you should base
your conclusions and interpretations on the best model you find. Write a report summarising your analysis.
Discard the target variable solar_system_count and the variable state (recording the US state of a tile).
Perform a cluster analysis on a subset of the predictor variables of your choice and compare the obtained clustering with the
classification into states. Motivate the choice of the subset of predictor variables in relation to the purpose of the cluster 
analysis and provide an interpretation of the detected clusters.
